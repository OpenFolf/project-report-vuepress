# Risk Analysis

In the following table we have taken together risk factors that could impact the project. Each risk is given the likelihood of 1-5. Then we made a rough estimate of the impact on the project if they were to happen. Overall risk is calculated by multiplying the other two factors.

| No. | Risk                                                                | Likelihood | Impact | Overall risk | Preemptive actions and measure taken to reduce risk                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Sick children and other family related issues                       | 4          | 4      | 16           | Team members can work from home and will do so if possible. Will keep their team members up to date so they could make arrangements.                                                                                                  |
| 2   | Unable to keep the project within scope                             | 4          | 4      | 16           | This is a big risk, because the idea for the project is so open. We are going to focus on minimum viable product listed in A requirement to have a fully working product within the time limit, before working on other requirements. |
| 3   | Disagreement within the team                                        | 3          | 3      | 9            | The team will try to keep good and frequent communication between all team members. But if there are any disagreements, we will voice them on the sprint retrospective to address the problem.                                        |
| 4   | Learning/setup for AWS back-end services takes longer than expected | 3          | 3      | 9            | Because this is a new environment for us there is a change that it will take some time to be able to connect everything together. We have contacted a specialist in AWS that has agreed to help us if it comes to that.               |
| 5   | Sick team member                                                    | 3          | 3      | 9            | Will work from home if they are able.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 6   | Learning Vue.js takes longer than expected                          | 2          | 3      | 6            | Is less of a worry than the back-end. All team members already have used different frameworks.                                                                                                                                        |
| 7   | Workload from other courses or work                                 | 3          | 2      | 6            | The team has gone over the semester calendar and know when most workload is expected, and the length of the scrum sprints reflect that. The team is ready to work extra in the latter part of the project                             |
| 8   | Database error/crash                                                | 1          | 5      | 5            | The database is stored online with Amazon Web Services. Crash or downtime of database therefore highly unlikely.                                                                                                                      |
| 9   | Losing access to code and documents                                 | 1          | 5      | 5            | All documents are stored online on Trello, Google Docs and GitHub. A team member has set up Google Drive that syncs with the cloud to have a local copy of files.                                                                     |
| 10  | Communication breakdown between team members.                       | 1          | 4      | 4            | Because there is only one weekly meeting this is a risk. Not having a private workspace contributes as well.                                                                                                                          |
| 11  | The site or its services go down                                    | 1          | 4      | 4            | AWS monitoring system that pings us if the anything goes down. We plan to have three different servers; Development, Staging and Production. Along with vigorous testing the chances are minimal.                                     |
| 12  | A team members laptop breaks down                                   | 2          | 1      | 2            | All team members have access to other computers. All source code and documents are saved online.                                                                                                                                      |
| 13  | Losing network connection                                           | 1          | 1      | 1            | All team members have the source code stored locally and can work on it if the connection is lost for a short period.                                                                                                                 |
