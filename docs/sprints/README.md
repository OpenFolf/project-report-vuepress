# SCRUM Sprints

## Sprint 0

The first sprint, one we chose to name sprint 0, started 16. January and lasted till 4. February. We deemed it necessary to study up on different frameworks we thought would fit our project. After a lot of consideration, we ended up deciding that Amazon Web Services (AWS) and related services would work for us. In order to cement the technical stack of the project a lot of time in this sprint was spent on studying up on AWS. The resulting technical environment can be seen in chapters 5.6 and 5.7. We had a pretty good idea that we wanted to use Vue.js for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. We spent some time in this sprint reading up on these frameworks to make sure that they were right for us.

The main purpose of this sprint was preparation for the work ahead. We had meetings to discuss work arrangements and high-level technical ideas. We started creating requirements for the application and user stories, researched other scorecard apps, made risk assessments and first sketches of the design of the application.

### Sprint 0 Retrospective

The first sprint went well, not least because we have worked together before. But because the team is unable to work physically together, some have full-time work, others are working nights and so on, but especially because we don´t have private workspace we can go to where we know the other members will be working, the communication between team members was lacking. We decided to create a virtual daily standup on slack to keep everyone up to date.

## Sprint 1

This sprint lasted from February 5th – 18th. On february 15th we hand to hand in our first draft of the report and had to present the assignment two days later for the instructor and XX. Because of that most of the sprit, for all three team members went into writing the report, finalizing the slides and so on. In this sprint we also got a workspace in SERES incubator near HR where we had space to work on our project.

### Sprint 1 Retrospective

Was mostly positive. We were happy with the work we had done on the report and the daily check in on slack gave everybody a much better overview of what other team members were doing made us more coordinated. Having a workspace at SERES was also a positive improvement.

## Sprint 2

February 19 till 4th of Mars. We got a lot of good feedback on our report from the instructor that needed addressing in the report. In this sprint the team started to divide assignments between our self, where Arnar and Ægir would fix and finalize the report and Dagur would start working on the backend full force. Though the main things that needed to be done on the report were to fix the flow chart, the requirements and write use cases, the whole sprint went into finalizing those things along with taking interviews. Creating detailed use cases meant that a lot of new requirements had to be written and reorganized, the flow chart was changed dramatically. The low-fi wireframes in the first report was almost all scraped. After all this work we were confident that we were at last ready to start programming the next sprint. We started the sprint with the goal of creating a new low-fi wireframe in order to perform usability testing for the application. But because of how detailed work we did on the use cases, we felt that that the we weren’t missing out or making some glaring mistake UX wise so we desisted that we would start programming the front end before performing usability testing. The goal of Dagur, while working on the back end was to ‘slice the cake’. As expected, there were some minor snags that had to figured out and fixed in order to do that, but by the end of the sprint first iteration of the sign up/sign in process was ready.

### Sprint 2 Retrospective

No major grievances, from any team members. The daily check in was still working well so communication was good. But we felt though that the report had been taking too much time and that the project was moving slowly. In our first timeline we had started programming by this time. However, the childcare and other strikes, sickness, a laptop of a team member breaking down and work in other courses had taken it toll on this project and made this sprint below par. All these things were however external factors and there was no problem with the project per se, so we hoped for the best and were excited to start work on the front end.

## Sprint 3

At the start of this sprit the backend was starting to take on form and it was time to start programming the front end…
