# Progress Overview

Using agile and Scrum to manage the project was logical because all the team members have learned about the methodology in other CS courses. In this chapter we show the sprint schedule of the project and the teamâ€™s distribution of work. Lastly there is a short summary of each sprint, what goals were set and what was achieved and the main point from the sprint retrospective.

Below is the sprint schedule for the project. The first sprint was 3 weeks, the next four will be 2-week sprints, then one sprint during the 3 weeks over the exam period and then 1-week sprints until hand-in of the project.

## Sprint Backlog

The group had its first meeting 1 month before the assignment started. There we shared ideas about the project and what technical environment we would use. At the start of the semester the tech stack had not been decided, except that we would write the front end in Vue.js. We wanted to implement a JAM stack with AWS as the back-end. But because of how different the stack was from what we knew from earlier work these first weeks were spent getting familiar with both Vue.js and AWS. There were some worries that implementing the back-end with AWS, without any prior experience of working with those services could be too much of a hurdle so making a simple Node.js server would be a backup solution.
