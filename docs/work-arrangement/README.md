# Work Arrangement

This chapter briefly lists what methodology the team will use, its workspace and how internal communication and documentation will be conducted.

## Methodology

We chose to use the SCRUM framework and the Agile methodology. We have all worked together before and we have learned that having the discipline of the SCRUM methodology has helped us to keep everything in order and within scope. The roles are as follows:

Product owner: Dagur Kristjánsson
Scrum Master: Arnar Arnarson
Team: Ægir Tómasson

## Sprint Arrangements

Because of how different the technical stack that we decided on is from the ‘typical’ stack taught at Reykjavik University, we took some time to learn about each technology before committing to it. We decided to have an initial sprint named sprint 0 to prepare and research the different technologies. The goal was to finish all planning and setup, to be able to start programing in sprint 1. We also decided that after sprint zero, the next three would be 2-week sprints. Then there would be one 3-week sprint over the exams and Easter. After that, we would change to 1-week sprints until the end of the project.

## Meetings and workspace

Three team members are family men and one of which is in a full-time job so holding daily standup's as per the SCRUM methodology was not optimal. We set up a daily check-in channel on our Slack where we do our daily stand-ups online. We try to keep workload over the weekends as small as possible. We are not doing the project for a company and therefore not assigned a private workspace. We applied and were able to get a workspace at SERES incubator center, after sprint 1. Before that time, we could not have a product backlog on the walls, but we use the collaboration tool Trello to keep track of artifacts and user stories and kept as a scrum task board.

## Technical Environment and documentation

Slack will be used for communication within the team. For file management and documentation, we use google drive, docs and sheets. Working with cloud computing allows all team members to work on documents regardless of their OS. GitHub will be used for hosting our version control and the collaboration tool Trello will be used as a digital Scrum board.
