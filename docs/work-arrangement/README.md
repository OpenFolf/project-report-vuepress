# Work Arrangement

This chapter briefly lists what methodology the team used while working on the _application_, its workspace and how internal communication and documentation was conducted.

## Methodology

We chose to use the Scrum framework and the Agile methodology. We have all worked together before and we have learned that having the discipline of the Scrum methodology has helped us to keep everything in order and within scope. The roles were as follows:

- **Product owner**: Dagur Kristjánsson
- **Scrum Master**: Arnar Arnarson
- **Team**: Ægir Tómasson

## Sprint Arrangements

Because of how different the technical stack was from what we had previously seen we decided to have an initial sprint named sprint 0 to prepare and research the different technologies. The goal was to finish all planning and setup, and to be able to start programing in sprint 1. We also decided that after sprint zero, the next three would be 2-week sprints. Then there would be one 3-week sprint over the exams and Easter. After that, we would change to 1-week sprints until the end of the project. This arrangement changed a little bit because of world affairs (COVID-19) forcing us to change the sprint length and dates a little bit. But we were roughly able to keep the original sprint plan. There is a more detailed description of the sprint executions in a later chapter.

## Meetings and workspace

Two of the three team members are family men and one of which had a full-time job so holding daily standups as per the Scrum methodology was not optimal. We set up a daily check-in channel on our Slack where we did our daily stand-ups online. We tried to keep workload over the weekends as small as possible. We were not doing the project for a company and therefore not assigned a private workspace. We applied and were able to get a workspace at SERES incubator center, after sprint 1. Before that time, we could not have a product backlog on the walls. Instead we used the collaboration tool Trello to keep track of artifacts and user stories and kept as a Scrum task board and have kept on using that arrangement.

## Technical Environment and documentation

Slack was used for communication within the team. For file management and documentation, we used Google drive, Docs and Sheets. Working with cloud computing allowed all team members to work on documents regardless of their OS. GitHub was used for hosting our version control and the collaboration tool Trello was our digital Scrum board. After the COVID-19 outbreak we used Microsoft Teams for video conferencing.

For setting up our continuous delivery system we used _AWS Amplify_, a service provided by _Amazon Web Services_, which enables you to set up your _GitHub_ repo for continuous delivery to the web.
